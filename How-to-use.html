    <div class="how_to_use">
  <h4>Step 1: Collect User Details</h4>
 <p> Begin by collecting basic details from the user. This includes their name, age, educational background, and any professional experience that might be relevant.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
  <h4>Step 2: Inquire About Disabilities</h4>
   <p>Ask the user if they have any disabilities or specific needs that should be taken into account during the goal-setting process. </p>

  <i> - If the user selects "No," proceed to Step 3.<br>
  - If the user selects "Yes," provide appropriate accommodations or options to ensure inclusivity and accessibility.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
    <h4>Step 3: Select Interests</h4>
      <p>Present the user with a selection of interests based on their profile and previous responses. Examples could include subjects like Chemistry, Coding (with images representing CSS, JavaScript, etc.), Biology, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
      
      <h4>Step 4: Answer Ability Questions</h4>
         <p>Based on the user's selected interests, present them with multiple-choice questions (MCQs) related to those topics. These questions are designed to assess the user's knowledge, skills, and preferences within each chosen interest area.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
        <h4>Step 5: Determine Goals</h4>
            <p>Utilizing the information gathered from the MCQs, provide personalized recommendations for achievable goals aligned with the user's interests, skills, and aspirations.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
          <h4>Step 6: Provide Goal Guidance</h4>
               <p>Offer guidance and actionable steps for the user to pursue their identified goals. This guidance should be tailored to the user's specific interests and capabilities, ensuring clarity and motivation in their goal-setting journey.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="how_to_use">
            <h4>Step 7: Explain Goal Achievement</h4>
                  <p>Provide an explanation to the user on how they can achieve their goals. This includes outlining resources, courses, mentors, or specific actions they can take based on their identified interests and abilities. It's important to empower the user with practical advice and encouragement to help them navigate towards success.</p>

  <i> This comprehensive approach ensures that the Goal Finder project not only assists users in setting meaningful goals but also equips them with the necessary guidance and resources to actively pursue and achieve those goals.</i> </div>
